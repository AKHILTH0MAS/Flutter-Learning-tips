3.  Creating Shapes and Obtaining SVG Code: Use fluttershapemaker.com, Flutter shape maker is a website that lets you create custom shapes and obtain their corresponding SVG code. You can customize various properties, such as size, corner radius, and color, and then copy the generated SVG code for use in your Flutter app.
    
4.  Using VS Code Snippets for Faster Development Take advantage of Visual Studio Code's snippet feature to create shortcuts for frequently used code snippets. By defining custom snippets, you can quickly insert boilerplate code, common widget configurations, or repetitive code patterns, boosting your development speed and productivity.
    
5.  Leveraging AI Tools: GitHub Copilot and Black Box, GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that provides suggestions and autocompletion for code snippets. It can help you write code faster by providing context-aware suggestions as you type. Additionally, Black Box is an AI-powered Flutter code generator that automates the creation of boilerplate code, reducing the amount of repetitive code you need to write manually.
    
6.  Utilizing gist.github.com, Gist.GitHub.com is a service provided by GitHub that allows you to share code snippets or small code samples. It's a handy tool for quickly sharing code with others or even for storing and retrieving your own code snippets. Gists can be easily shared and accessed, making collaboration and code reuse more convenient.

By incorporating these tips into your Flutter development workflow, you can streamline your coding process, save time, and enhance the overall efficiency of your app development.
## Effective state managementü•µ
